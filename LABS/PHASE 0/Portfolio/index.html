                <h4>Welcome to my portfolio</h4>
            </p>
            I recently completed high school and joined Moringa School to enhance my expertise in programming.<br>
             I have a keen interest in coding. I look forward to increasing my dexterity in the area.

           <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        I have several hobbies. 
        I fancy a couple of activities among them are:reading books, swimming, writing, crotcheting and  baking.
      <ol>
        <li>
              I enoy reading books since almost all problems have their solutions encoded in between the covers of a good book.
                While non-fiction books offer guidance and insight to new horizons fiction books aren't to be discredited. Fiction books cultivate the readers' empathy since they are forced to put themselves in the characters' shoes.
                It also grows the creativity of the reader by having them picture the scenarios they read about in their minds' eye.
        </li>
         <li>
           Of swimming I have not much to say. It is a sport I indulge myself in mostly for recreation.
           It exercises the muscles and improves one's physical well-being. 
           I especially loved swimming in high school where it was a welcome break from all the hours spent in the classroom.
        </li>
        <li>
          A friend of mine introduced me to crotcheting when i was in primary school. 
          Since then, I have been unable to put my crotcheting needle down.
          She taught me the basics of the art and I expanded my knowledge through youtube tutorials.
          So far I am able to crotchet beautiful bags. However, recently I began trying my hand at garments.
          I have also taken a liking to knitting though my skills are sub-standard at best.
        </li>
        <li>
           I also occassionally write poems and pieces of literature. 
           Words help me convey my thoughts and ideas which is why I particularly love it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I bake from time to time.From cakes to buns and even mousses. I took up baking due to the insatiable sweet tooth that I have.
           Though my initial reason for baking was rather selfish, I have been able to bake for my family members who enjoy my baking.
        </li>

        <h2>Spirit Animal</h2>
       <h4> Owl Spirit Animal</h4>
       <div class="imageowl">
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/65/75/fc/6575fcdb8aeede641f0cb9f2f0bf928c.jpg" alt="owl spirit animal">

    <p id="p1">The owl spirit animal is emblematic of a deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge.
       If you have the owl as totem or power animal, you’re likely to have the ability to see what’s usually hidden to most.
        When the spirit of this animal guides you, you can see the true reality, beyond illusion and deceit.
         The owl also offers for those who have it a personal totem the inspiration and guidance necessary to deeply explore the unknown and the magic of life.
    </p> 
 
    <p id="p2"> <h4>Owl Symbolism</h4>
The owl is a powerful and symbolic animal in many cultures and traditions worldwide.
With its piercing gaze and silent flight, it embodies the essence of wisdom and knowledge, guiding us through the darkness of the unknown and illuminating the truths that lie beneath the surface.

In its solitary and silent presence, it reminds us that true understanding can be only achieved through introspection and self-reflection. 
And yet, there is also an eerie quality to the owl, a sense of ominousness and death that reflects our own fleeting existence and the transience of all things.

By embracing the owl’s symbolism – both light and dark – we can learn to navigate life’s twists and turns with confidence, purpose, and a deeper understanding of our own nature and the world we live in.
